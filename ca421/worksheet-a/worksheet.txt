DCU – CA421 Software Patterns & Metrics
Worksheet A:
The Adapter Pattern The Observer Pattern
This week we look at some applications of the Adapter & Observer Patterns

• QUESTION 1 – Convert Turkeys to Ducks
Try the example from the notes of adapting a Turkey to a Duck.

• QUESTION 2 – Convert an Enumeration to an Iteration
Create a Vector of a bunch of integers. The extract an Enumerator from the Vector
(check the API for how to do this). Then use an adapter to convert this Enumerator
into an Iterator. Finally, move through the Iterator, printing up each number.

• QUESTION 3 – Should I Do It?
Implement and test the simple “Should I Do It?” question from the notes on the
Observer pattern.

• QUESTION 4 – Dunno
Add another listener to the button from question 1. This time the listener should print
the message “I don’t know!”.

• QUESTION 5 – Dunno just three times.
Modify question 2 so that the “I don’t know!” listener is removed after three clicks on
the button.

• QUESTION 6 - Threads
Implement and test a simple threaded application which has two threads, each of
which prints a message 100 times. The first thread should print “hello” and the second
thread should print “goodbye”.

• QUESTION 7 – Threads with Weather
Implement and test a simple Weather application which generates random
temperature, pressure and humidity in a thread, in random intervals ranging from 5 to
15 seconds. The Weather subject should allow observers to attach and detach
themselves. Allow the Weather subject to notify observers. The observers should then
be able to retrieve the data they want (i.e. using the ‘Pull’ method).
Add three listeners:
(1) Snow listener: Prints a warning message when the temperature drops
below 3 degrees and the humidity is above 75%.
(2) Heatwave listener: Prints a warning when the temperature is above 35
degrees.
(3) InSpace listener: Prints a warning when the pressure drops below 10.
What changes would be required to your design to use the ‘Push’ method?
