In order for me to change the observable model from pull to push, I would need to change the following things.

1) I would need to send the data along with the update method, whereas in the pull model I just call
    update and the observer can do whatever it wants with the observable object

N.B The pull method is nice in the way it allows each observer to get whatever publicly available data it
    wants to access.
