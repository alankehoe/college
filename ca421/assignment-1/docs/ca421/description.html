    <h1>How it works</h1>
    My program implements the Observer Pattern, Decorator Pattern and the Singleton Pattern.
    I have implemented a simple hospital system in which you can have a patient and also hook that patient
    up to a monitor. There are two monitors
    <ol>
        <li>Heart Rate Monitor</li>
        <li>Body Temperature Monitor</li>
    </ol>
    A patient is a Singleton object that implements the Person interface. When a patient is
    created monitors can be attached to that patient. The monitors implement the pull method of an observer
    this means that they can do with the data what they want they both have an update method which can be called from
    the Patient object. When the observers receive the data they can either do nothing or give the patient some
    medicine.

    I also implemented the Decorator pattern in this program. The Decorator is used to create a prescription for the
    user.
    there is an initial fee for each medicine and the decorator can add to this when creating the prescription.
    there are two types of medicine.
    <ol>
        <li>Heart Medicine</li>
        <li>Body Temperature Medicine</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Patterns implemented in this program</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Observer (Pull model)</li>
        <li>Decorator</li>
        <li>Singleton</li>
    </ol>
