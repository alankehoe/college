Problems:

1)We couldnt get the heap to implement properly and therefore our code is not as lightweight as possible
We sort the nodes as they are added, comparing against one another on a basis.
When one is removed the index's are shifted as they are already in order.

This approach is not as optomized as a heap, but we could not get the heap to work properly.

2)Neither myself or alan could implement pthread_cond_timewait in order to avoid busy waiting.

We simply lacked the timing knowlage to make this method work with our program.
