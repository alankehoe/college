        <p align="center"><strong><font size="5"><u>Symmetric File Encryption Using Password and Salt</u></font></strong></p>
        <p><br>
          The aim of this assignment is to perform symmetric encryption of a file using the block cipher AES
          where the key is derived from a <i>password</i> and a <i>salt</i>.</p>

        <p>The password you use should be encoded using UTF-8 and be considered to be "strong". The salt will be a randomly 
           generated 128-bit value. The password (<i>p</i>) and salt (<i>s</i>) will be concatenated together 
           (<i>p||s</i>) and hashed 200 times using SHA-256. The resulting digest (<i>H<sup>200</sup>(p||s)</i>) 
           will then be used as your 256-bit AES key (<i>k</i>).</p>
          
        <p>You will then encrypt an input file using AES in CBC mode with the 256-bit key <i>k</i> and a block 
           size of 128-bits. The IV for this encryption (<i>i</i>) will be a randomly generated 128-bit value.
           You will use the following padding scheme (as given in lectures): if the final part of the message is 
           less than the block size, append a 1-bit and fill the rest of the block with 0-bits; if the final part
           of the message is equal to the block size, then create an extra block starting with a 1-bit and fill 
           the rest of the block with 0-bits.</p>

        <p>You will then encrypt your password using RSA with the encryption exponent (<i>e</i>) and my public modulus (<i>N</i>).
           This is done by calculating <i>p<sup>e</sup></i> (mod <i>N</i>). This will use your own implementation 
           of modular exponentiation rather than a library method for this purpose. For the purpose of this assignment 
           no padding should be added to the password before encryption (although this would normally be done).</p>

        <p>The encryption exponent (<i>e</i>) is 65537 and my public modulus (<i>N</i>) has the following value (in hexadecimal):</p>

        <p>The implementation language must be Java. You will have to make use of the BigInteger class (java.math.BigInteger),
           the security libraries (java.security.*) and the crypto libraries (javax.crypto.*). 
           You must not make use of the modular exponentiation method provided by the BigInteger class; 
           all modular exponentiation must be done using one of the two methods described in the lectures.
           You can however make use of the security and crypto libraries to perform the AES encryption and 
           the SHA-256 hashing.</p>

        <p>You should send me the following by email:
        </p><ul>
          <li>Your 128-bit salt (<i>s</i>) in hexadecimal.</li>
          <li>Your 128-bit IV (<i>i</i>) in hexadecimal.</li>
          <li>Your password encrypted using RSA as described above in hexadecimal.</li>          
          <li>An unencrypted version of your code.</li>
          <li>Your code encrypted using AES as described above in hexadecimal.</li>
          <li>A declaration that this is solely your own work (except elements that are explicitly attributed to another source).</li>
        </ul>When I receive your email I will decrypt your password <i>p</i> using my RSA private key. 
             Using this password and your salt <i>s</i> I will then generate your AES key <i>k</i> using SHA-256. 
             I will then use this to decrypt the encrypted version of your code. 
             This should be the same as the unencrypted version of your code for a correct submission.<p></p>

        <p> This assignment is due <b>10am on Monday 18<sup>th</sup> November.
        <strong><u>Submissions without the declaration will not be assessed.</u></strong> 
          This assignment carries 15 marks and late submissions will have 
          1.5 marks deducted for each 24 hours the assignment is overdue.</b></p><b>
